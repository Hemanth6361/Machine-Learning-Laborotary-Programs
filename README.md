# Machine-Learning-Laborotary-Programs
Implement and evaluate ML algorithms in Python/Java programming language

1. Implement and demonstratetheFIND-Salgorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read    the training data from a .CSV file and show the output for test cases. Develop an interactive program by Compareing the result by          implementing LIST THEN ELIMINATE algorithm.

2. For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Eliminationalgorithm. Output a    description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.

3. Demonstrate Pre processing (Data Cleaning, Integration and Transformation) activity on suitable data:                                      For example:                                                                                                                                Identify and Delete Rows that Contain Duplicate Data by considering an appropriate dataset.                                                Identify and Delete Columns That Contain a Single Value by considering an appropriate dataset.

4. Demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply      this knowledge toclassify a new sample.
